### Hi there 👋

<!--
**kevinfergus/kevinfergus** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi, my name is Kevin Fergus. I'm a software engineer with a proven ability to work creatively in both small and large team environments. For a team project, I was responsible for the front end and I took it upon myself to learn Django back end to ensure smooth interactions without the need to delay the back end engineer’s other work. I built an ecommerce site in 8 days with 4 teammates using a creative approach to cart schema design, ultimately removing the need for a separate carts table. With a passion for personal growth, I attended a 1,000+ hour Fullstack bootcamp to both learn new coding techniques and sharpen my existing skills. I am now looking for an opportunity to use these skills in a collaborative environment with other passionate technologists creating delightful experiences for end users.

Frontend Software Engineer with a proven ability to deliver quality results in both solo and collaborative settings. Prior to transitioning to software development, I led and championed training initiatives for Fortune 500 companies (i.e. Amazon, Home Depot) on best inclusive practices for people with disabilities, ultimately resulting in 2,000+ managers learning my techniques. The same passion I have for inclusivity and collaboration, I also have for software development. Embracing this passion led me to work through 1,000+ hour coding bootcamp, which focused on JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I am now eager to apply these passions in obtaining a challenging position on a collaborative development team focused on creating high-quality, intuitive front-end applications.
